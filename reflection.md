|Reflection - Hibernate as an ORM tool seems interesting, though will need to spend a lot of time working on it. Not comfortable at all with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Consideration for application : joining tables?|12|

|Week 7 (10/14-10/20/2019)| Hours Worked|
|----------|----------|
|-expecting integer when string was provided - I did not write the right method to return a card by its name. The method I wrote and functions I used were asking instead for an integer and not a string. This caused a lot of frustration on my part as I did not know how to resolve it. <br> - typemismatchexception - I created a foreign key and did not specifically assign a name qualifier. The code was assuming a different foreign key name than the one I provided, which caused alot of issues for me. <br> - empty query - running my cleandb file resulted in this which I was not able to resolve. <br> - ran into an issue mapping my one-to-many relationships. Finally understood the entity (YugiohCard table) does not mapp to the YugiohCardHistory table. Actually, its an instance of the YugiohCard object that mapps to the table.|25|
|Reflection - finally UAT is done! Production release this weekend; went to get help with updatind resume; attended career fair and spoke with Moxie, WPS, American Family and others; really liked Todd from Am Fam who gave me really good advice.

|----------|----------|
|- watched week 11 videos <br> - completed week 11 readings <br> - completed week 11 exercise <br> - continued work on project - need to decide on one layout design and stick with it.|25|
|Reflection - Feeling the pressue of not getting the project done with all of the features I had planned. Consuming APIs is more complicated than I thought. I'm stuck trying to request an authorization token for an API I wanted to use to return current prices. Will see if I can get to and implement Ebay APIs. Otherwise, this will be phase 2 of my project.|

|Week 15 (12/09-12/15/2019)|Hours Worked|
|----------|----------|
|- worked on code review <br> - worked on project <br> - Wrote up file of cardsets and their full cardset names; wrote helper class YugiohCardFileReader to read and parse into a map of key-value pairs for use with service call.<br> - decided to change delete logic; delete will now change a card status to "delete"; thought over how that will impact add/edit logic and started writing code|30|
|Reflection - For data entry, I was going off of the 3 letter cardSet abbreviation on the card; the service call wants instead the actual product name of the card to be able to retrieve any information for the card; there is no current on-line help for this. Such a waste of time creating, then writing the code to parse. I've been in the computer lab almost every day within the last 3 months working on this. Too many indecisions is keeping me from getting work done sooner.|

|Week 16 (12/09-12/19/2019)|Hours Worked|
|----------|----------|
|- Added two new columns to YugiohCard table: cardEdition and cardProductName; cardEdition was an oversight on my part, which I completely forgot about. CardProductName is me wanting to store and display more information on the browser.<br> - Changed up control flow for logging in and out of app. Initially had login servlet as the landing page but changed it since a user would only land on the page when the application is first deployed or reloaded. During other times, logout and then login and navigation did not work. Also, had last minute epiphany and rewrote CRUD logic and new helper class YugiohCardProcessor for help with making service calls. <br> Wednesday - no video nor AWS deployment yet.<br> |18|
|Reflection - Not done recording nor deploying to AWS. Last minute decisions to add two new columns to YugiohCard table and rewrite CRUD logic has got me pushing my limits. Stressed! Not done with new add/edit logic; not able to finish updating edit JSP to properly display card information. So disappointed. Will demo what I can and call it a semester.|
