|Reflection - Feeling the pressue of not getting the project done with all of the features I had planned. Consuming APIs is more complicated than I thought. I'm stuck trying to request an authorization token for an API I wanted to use to return current prices. Will see if I can get to and implement Ebay APIs. Otherwise, this will be phase 2 of my project.|
