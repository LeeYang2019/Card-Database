### Presentation Description/Overview

Buying and selling trading cards is something I enjoy doing, especially a card game called Yugioh. It started as a silly game my friends and I played in highschool to kill time, as we waited for our parents to come pick us up after school. Short of an obsession, Yugioh has become for me a life-long hobby that I spend a lot of time on. Although I do not play the game as much anymore, I spend a lot of time scouring the internet and local card stores looking for Yugioh cards and selling them online. 

One issue I have with buying and selling Yugioh cards, is keeping tracking of and knowing when to sell a card, and selling the card in bulk. As a collector and seller of Yugioh cards, I pride myself in my ability to find "diamonds in the rough" and selling them when their prices have gone up. 

At the heart of what I'm doing, I are creating the following:

1. A database to track my Yugioh cards. So often the case, whenever I am looking for something I cannot tell if I have it. And since I have so many cards in boxes, shelves, and binders, it can be a hassle for me to have to go through all of my cards to see if I have the card I am looking for. To that end, if I have a database that stores my Yugioh cards and can help me find them can save me so much time in the long run.

2. An application that can identify for me which of the cards I own have appreciated or depreciated in value. If I know a card has appreciated in value, I can sell it.

3. An application that can post my cards on Ebay. The easier I can post to Ebay and the more of it that I can post, the sooner I am putting a card out that I can then sell and the more money I can make.
