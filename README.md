### Presentation Description/Overview

Buying and selling Yu-Gi-Oh! trading cards is something I enjoy doing. It's a passion of mine which began when I was in high school. To kill time, my friends and I would play Yu-Gi-Oh! as we waited for our parents to come pick us up from school. Now many years later, I don't play the game as much anymore but what I do I spend a lot of time scouring buying and selling cards. I would scour the internet and local card stores looking for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and sell them online. 

One issue I have with buying and selling Yugioh cards, is keeping tracking of and knowing when to sell a card, and selling the card in bulk. As a collector and seller of Yugioh cards, I pride myself in my ability to find "diamonds in the rough" and selling them when their prices have gone up. 

At the heart of what I'm doing, I are creating the following:

1. A database to track my Yugioh cards. So often the case, whenever I am looking for something I cannot tell if I have it. And since I have so many cards in boxes, shelves, and binders, it can be a hassle for me to have to go through all of my cards to see if I have the card I am looking for. To that end, if I have a database that stores my Yugioh cards and can help me find them can save me so much time in the long run.

2. An application that can identify for me which of the cards I own have appreciated or depreciated in value. If I know a card has appreciated in value, I can sell it.

3. An application that can post my cards on Ebay. The easier I can post to Ebay and the more of it that I can post, the sooner I am putting a card out that I can then sell and the more money I can make.
